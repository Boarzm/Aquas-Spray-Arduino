Arduino code for a smart irrigation system that consists of three solenoid valve, three soil moisture sensors and a waterflow semsor. 
When soil moisture sensors detect dryness, solenoid valves are triggered to open and allow irrigation to tale place for each area that I dry.
The flow sensor measures the flow of water and can be used to measure the amount of water flowing and the parameters are displayed on the serial monitor
